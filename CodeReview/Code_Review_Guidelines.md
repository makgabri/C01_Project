# Code Review Guidelines

## Code Review Setup

Before beginning the code review, we quickly went through the material discussed during the lecture on code review. After that we decided that each person would pick a file or piece of code that they DID NOT write, and share that with the team so that we would know who was reviewing

* Each person picks a piece of code or a file that they DID NOT write
  * They would let the team know before reviewing so that there is no overlap
* They would review that file and other files up to the limit of 200 lines of code
* We spent about 45 minutes of our weekly team meeting conducting a code review, and established that we would also be setting aside time to conduct code review over the next several days
* Code/classes that were reviewed were added to a list on Trello so that we could keep track of what had been review

## What To Look For

When conducting our code review these are the things that we were looking for:

* Readability of the code: can we follow along with what you're doing
* Maintainability: if we had to do maintenance or modifications on your code, would we easily be able to
* Redundancy/efficiency: are you doing more work than you need to be doing, is your work efficient. Is the extra work being done a result of inefficiency or is it unnecessary in general
* Testing: are you testing your code and making sure that it works before committing it to any main branches

## Post-Code Review

After completing the first code review, we shared our findings with the team so that we could all make sure we were on the same page as to what we were looking for, and the quality of feedback we should be giving.

For the code reviews after that if any issues were found, the reviewer is supposed to contact the author and discuss with them the issues so that they get resolved.
